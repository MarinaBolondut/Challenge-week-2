## My process

Firstly, I made sure the grid layout was set for the main section and after I build the header and the navbar and designed the layout of the main content and finished with the footer.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### Continued development

There is more work to be done on the my work area to add 2 more projects and images to the grid layout.
